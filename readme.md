This is a basic stream command parsing library, it is based on Arduino-SerialCommand but allows use of any Stream interface that commands might come through, perhaps Serial, BLE and/or an SD card stream.

This repo is set up for using with PlatformIO.

Based on Arduino-SerialCommand:
----------------------------------------
A Wiring/Arduino library to tokenize and parse commands received over a serial port. 

The original version of this library was written by [Steven Cogswell](http://husks.wordpress.com) (published May 23, 2011 in his blog post ["A Minimal Arduino Library for Processing Serial Commands"](http://husks.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/a-minimal-arduino-library-for-processing-serial-commands/)).

This is a heavily modified version with smaller footprint and a cleaned up code by Stefan Rado.
